#x=fun(f) #this line work as the decorator #calling function fun and passing the reference of f function    
#x() #calling function 
#instead of doing this we can use the way how to actually declare the decorator
#when a argument is passed inside the last function like in this case f function have one argument that is hello but the decorator 
#function doesn't have any argument the wrapper and the reference function func doesn't have any argument
#therefore pass *args and **kwargs to both of these function which allow us to give as many as argument you want to passed
